## Dataset overview

### Introduction

This dataset comprises real commercial data from a Brazilian e-commerce platform, Olist Store, covering 100,000 orders spanning 2016 to 2018. It provides comprehensive insights into various dimensions, including order status, pricing, payment, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. The data has been anonymized, and references to companies and partners have been replaced with names inspired by Game of Thrones great houses. Additionally, a geolocation dataset linking Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates is available.
